Provides a taxonomy for tracking changes to services within my home lab, and an excuse to learn 
 how [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) works.

Thanks to [Alex Kretzschmar](https://github.com/ironicbadger)'s various blog  posts about using Ansible.

## Getting started

- Install git commit pre-hook:
  `./git-init.sh`

- Install requirements:
  `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yaml`

Edit away.
