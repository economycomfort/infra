Provides a taxonomy for tracking changes to services within my home lab, and an excuse to learn 
 how [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) works.

Thanks to [Alex Kretzschmar](https://github.com/ironicbadger)'s various blog posts about using Ansible.

## Getting started

- Install git commit pre-hook:
  `./git-init.sh`
