# economycomfort/infra

Code used to deploy various services on my home network.
Largely used to learn more about Ansible and infrastructure-as-code,
and by nature will probably never be "complete."

Evolved from the work of [Alex Kretzschmar](https://github.com/ironicbadger),
and all the people that his work evolved from.  His various blog posts about 
using Ansible convinced me to give it a whirl.  Things have progressed rapidly
since I was an every-day-sysadmin over a decade ago, so it's enriching to learn
a bit about how things are handled and scaled out today.

Hopefully somebody else finds this useful.  Note that most things are specific
to my environment, and will likely need to be modified for deployment elsewhere.
