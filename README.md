# zerobaud/infra

Code used to deploy various services on my home network.
Largely used to learn more about Ansible and infrastructure-as-code,
and by nature will probably never be "complete."

Evolved from the work of [Alex Kretzschmar](https://github.com/ironicbadger).
His various blog posts about using Ansible convinced me to give it a whirl.
